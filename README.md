## Objective the project
Mosaic is a platform where you can create posts about mainly tech and other stuffs and share them with the world. You can also read posts created by other users and comment on them.

## Tech Stacks Used

## Details about intuition
<ul type="bullet">
  <li>I have used React and Tailwind CSS to design the frontend part.</li>
  <li>When an user signs up/logs in into their account, they can create their own posts and share publicly where others posts of different users can be seen.</li>
  <li>CRUD operations are available in case of an user's posts.</li>
  <li>I have tried to add a comment functionality also ( Though it needs massive improvement ).</li>
</ul>

## Future Plans
<ul type="bullet">
  <li>Working on the comment functionality</li>
  <li>Different posting options will be available ( images, videos etc )</li>
  <li>Implementing a chatbot to give suggestions of what kind of writings users can post.</li>
